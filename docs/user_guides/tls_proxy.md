# How to enable use TLS proxy

Milvus proxy uses TLS mutual authentication. 



## How to create your own certificate.

### 1. Make sure openssl is installed. 
```shell
openssl version
```
If openssl is not installed. It can be installed like this in Ubuntu.
```shell
sudo apt install openssl
```
### 2. Create openssl.cnf and gen.sh
```shell
mkdir cert && cd cert
touch openssl.cnf gen.sh
```
Copy the configuration below into the file. You can modify gen.ssh configurations.

CommonName is a required configuration. The client needs to specify the server name when connecting. The server name is common name.

Other configurations can be filled in as required.

# To use this configuration file with the "-extfile" option of the
# "openssl x509" utility, name here the section containing the
# X.509v3 extensions to use:
# extensions		= 
# (Alternatively, use a configuration file that has only
# X.509v3 extensions in its main [= default] section.)

# We can add new OIDs in here for use by 'ca', 'req' and 'ts'.
# Add a simple OID like this:

# Or use config file substitution like this:
# testoid2=${testoid1}.5.6

```
</details>

### 3. Run gen.sh to create certificate.
```shell
chmod +x gen.sh
./gen.sh
```
They will creat 9 files about ca.key, ca.pem, ca.srl, server.key, server.pem, server.csr, client.key, client.pem, client.csr.

## Modify config
Modify tlsEnabled to true and the file path in config/milvus.yaml.  
Server need server.pem, server.key and ca.pem. Client need client.pem, client.key, ca.pem.
```yaml
tls:
  serverPemPath: configs/cert/server.pem
  serverKeyPath: configs/cert/server.key
  caPemPath: configs/cert/ca.pem

common:
  security:
    tlsEnabled: true
```


## How does the client use tls to connect to milvus
