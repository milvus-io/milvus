OpenBLAS ChangeLog
====================================================================
Version 0.3.5
31-Dec-2018

common:
	* loop unrolling in TRMV has been enabled again.
	* A domain error in the thread workload distribution for SYRK
	  has been fixed.
	* gmake builds will now automatically add -fPIC to the build
	  options if the platform requires it.
	* a pthreads key leakage (and associate crash on dlclose) in
	  the USE_TLS codepath was fixed.
	* building of the utest cases on systems that do not provide
	  an implementation of complex.h was fixed.
	  
x86_64:
	* the SkylakeX code was changed to compile on OSX.
	* unwanted application of the -march=skylake-avx512 option
	  to the common code parts of a DYNAMIC_ARCH build was fixed.
	* improved performance of SGEMM for small workloads on Skylake X.
	* performance of SGEMM and DGEMM was improved on Haswell.

ARMV8:
	* a configuration error that broke the CNRM2 kernel was corrected.
	* compilation of the GEMM kernels with CMAKE was fixed.
	* DYNAMIC_ARCH builds are now available with CMAKE as well.
	* using CMAKE for cross-compilation to the new cpu TARGETs
	  introduced in 0.3.4 now works.
	  
POWER:
	* a problem in cpu autodetection for AIX has been corrected.
	
====================================================================
Version 0.3.4
02-Dec-2018

common:
	* the new, experimental thread-local memory allocation had 
	  inadvertently been left enabled for gmake builds in 0.3.3
	  despite the announcement. It is now disabled by default, and
	  single-threaded builds will keep using the old allocator even
	  if the USE_TLS option is turned on.
	* OpenBLAS will now provide enough buffer space for at least 50
	  threads by default.
	* The output of openblas_get_config() now contains the version
	  number.
	* A serious thread safety bug in GEMV operation with small M and
	  large N size has been fixed.
	* The code will now automatically call blas_thread_init after a
	  fork if needed before handling a call to openblas_set_num_threads
	* Accesses to parallelized level3 functions from multiple callers
	  are now serialized to avoid thread races (unless using OpenMP).
	  This should provide better performance than the known-threadsafe
	  (but non-default) USE_SIMPLE_THREADED_LEVEL3 option.
	* When building LAPACK with gfortran, -frecursive is now (again)
	  enabled by default to ensure correct behaviour.
        * The OpenBLAS version cblas.h now supports both CBLAS_ORDER and
	  CBLAS_LAYOUT as the name of the matrix row/column order option.
	* Externally set LDFLAGS are now passed through to the final compile/link
	  steps to facilitate setting platform-specific linker flags.
	* A potential race condition during the build of LAPACK (that would 
	  usually manifest itself as a failure to build TESTING/MATGEN) has been 
	  fixed.
	* xHEMV has been changed to stay single-threaded for small input sizes
	  where the overhead of multithreading exceeds any possible gains
	* CSWAP and ZSWAP have been limited to a single thread except on ARMV8 or
	  ThunderX hardware with sizable input.
	* Linker flags for the PGI compiler have been updated
	* Behaviour of AXPY with zero increments is now handled in the C interface,
	  correcting the result on at least Intel Atom.
	* The result matrix from calling SGELSS with an all-zero input matrix is 
	  now zeroed completely.
	  
x86_64:
	* Autodetection of AMD Ryzen2 has been fixed (again).
        * CMAKE builds now support labeling of an INTERFACE64=1 build of
	  the library with the _64 suffix.
	* AVX512 version of DGEMM has been added and the AVX512 SGEMM kernel
	  has been sped up by rewriting with C intrinsics
	* Fixed compilation on RHEL5/CENTOS5 (issue with typename __WAIT_STATUS)
	
POWER:
	* added support for building on AIX (with gcc and GNU tools from AIX Toolbox).
	* CPU type detection has been implemented for AIX.
	* CPU type detection has been fixed for NETBSD.
	
MIPS64:
	* AXPY on LOONGSON3A has been corrected to pass "zero increment" utest.
	* DSDOT on LOONGSON3A has been fixed.
	* the SGEMM microkernel has been hardened against potential data loss.
	
ARMV8:
	* DYNAMic_ARCH support is now available for 64bit ARM
	* cross-compiling for ARMV8 under iOS now works.
	* cpu-specific code has been rearranged to make better use of both
	  hardware commonalities and model-specific compiler optimizations.
	* XGENE1 has been removed as a TARGET, superseded by the improved generic
	  ARMV8 support.
	
ARMV7:
	* Older assembly mnemonics have been converted to UAL form to allow
	  building with clang 7.0
	* Cross compiling LAPACKE for Android has been fixed again (broken by
	  update to LAPACK 3.7.0 some while ago).  
	  
====================================================================
Version 0.3.3
31-Aug-2018

common:
	* thread memory allocation has been switched back to the method
	  used before version 0.3.1 due to unexpected problems caused by
	  the new code under some circumstances. A new compile-time option
	  USE_TLS has been added to enable the new code, and it is hoped
	  that this can become the default again in the next version.
	* LAPAck PR272 has been integrated, which fixes spurious errors
	  in DSYEVR and related functions caused by missing conversion 
	  from ILAENV to ILAENV_2STAGE in several _2stage routines.
	* the cmake-generated OpenBLASConfig.cmake now uses correct case
	  for the name of the library
	* added support for Haiku OS

ARMV7:
	* corrected xDOT behaviour with zero INC_X or INC_Y

	  (which will still be supported via the slower PRESCOTT kernels when this option is not set)
	* added an option DYNAMIC_LIST that (used in conjunction with DYNAMIC_ARCH) allows to 
	  specify the list of x86_64 targets to include. Any target not on the list will be supported 
	  by the Sandybridge or Nehalem kernels if available, or by Prescott.
	* improved SWITCH_RATIO on Haswell for increased GEMM throughput
	* added initial support for Intel Skylake X, including an AVX512 SGEMM kernel
	* added autodetection of Intel Cannon Lake series as Skylake X
