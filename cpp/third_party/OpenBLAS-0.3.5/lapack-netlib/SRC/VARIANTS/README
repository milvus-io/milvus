This README File is for the LAPACK driver variants.
It is composed of 5 sections:
	- Description: contents a quick description of each of the variants. For a more detailed description please refer to LAWN XXX.
	- Build
	- Testing
	- Linking your program
	- Support

= DESCRIPTION =
===============

This directory contains several variants of LAPACK routines in single/double/complex/double complex precision:
	- [sdcz]getrf with LU Crout Level 3 BLAS version algorithm [2]- Directory: SRC/VARIANTS/lu/CR
	- [sdcz]getrf with LU Left Looking Level 3 BLAS version algorithm [2]- Directory: SRC/VARIANTS/lu/LL
	- [sdcz]getrf with Sivan Toledo's recursive LU algorithm [1] - Directory: SRC/VARIANTS/lu/REC
	- [sdcz]geqrf with QR Left Looking Level 3 BLAS version algorithm [2]- Directory: SRC/VARIANTS/qr/LL
	- [sdcz]potrf with Cholesky Right Looking Level 3 BLAS version algorithm [2]- Directory: SRC/VARIANTS/cholesky/RL
	- [sdcz]potrf with Cholesky Top Level 3 BLAS version algorithm [2]- Directory: SRC/VARIANTS/cholesky/TOP

=========
= BUILD =
=========

These variants are compiled by default in the build process but they are not tested by default.
The build process creates one new library per variants in the four arithmetics (single real/double real/single complex/double complex).
The libraries are in the SRC/VARIANTS directory.

Corresponding libraries created in SRC/VARIANTS:
	- LU Crout : lucr.a
	- LU Left Looking : lull.a
	- LU Sivan Toledo's recursive : lurec.a
	- QR Left Looking : qrll.a
	- Cholesky Right Looking : cholrl.a
	- Cholesky Top : choltop.a


===========
= TESTING =
===========

To test these variants you can type 'make variants-testing'
This will rerun the linear methods testings once per variants and append the short name of the variants to the output files.
You should then see the following files in the TESTING directory:
[scdz]test_cholrl.out
[scdz]test_choltop.out
[scdz]test_lucr.out
[scdz]test_lull.out
[scdz]test_lurec.out
[scdz]test_qrll.out

========================
= LINKING YOUR PROGRAM =
========================

You just need to add the variants methods library in your linking sequence before your lapack libary.
Here is a quick example for LU

Default using LU Right Looking version:
 $(FORTRAN) -c myprog.f
 $(FORTRAN) -o myexe myprog.o $(LAPACKLIB) $(BLASLIB)

Using LU Left Looking version:
 $(FORTRAN) -c myprog.f
 $(FORTRAN) -o myexe myprog.o $(PATH TO LAPACK/SRC/VARIANTS)/lull.a $(LAPACKLIB) $(BLASLIB)
