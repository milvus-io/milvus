## What is Milvus?

[Milvus](https://milvus.io/) is a [high-performance](https://zilliz.com/vector-database-benchmark-tool) vector database built for scale. It is used by AI applications to organize and search through large amounts of unstructured data, such as text and images.

Milvus is implemented with Go and C++ and employs CPU/GPU instruction-level optimization for vector search efficiency. It has a [fully-distributed architecture on K8s](https://milvus.io/docs/overview.md#What-Makes-Milvus-so-Scalable) to handle tens of thousands of search queries on billions of vectors, scale horizontally and maintain data freshness by processing streaming data updates in real-time. For smaller use cases, Milvus also supports [Standalone mode](https://milvus.io/docs/install_standalone-docker.md) that can run on Docker. In addition, [Milvus Lite](https://milvus.io/docs/milvus_lite.md) is a lightweight version suitable for quickstart in python with simply `pip install`.

Milvus is also available as a fully managed service on [Zilliz Cloud with free trial](https://cloud.zilliz.com/signup).

The Milvus open-source project is
under [LF AI & Data Foundation](https://lfaidata.foundation/projects/milvus/), distributed with [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/blob/master/LICENSE) License.

## Quickstart

```python
$ pip install -U pymilvus
```

This installs `pymilvus`, a Python SDK for Milvus. It also includes Milvus Lite for quickstart with a local vector database. Simply instantiate a client with a local file name to persist all data:

```python
from pymilvus import MilvusClient
client = MilvusClient("milvus_demo.db")
```

For [Milvus Standalone on Docker](https://milvus.io/docs/install_standalone-docker.md) and [Milvus Distributed on Kubernetes](https://milvus.io/docs/install_cluster-milvusoperator.md), specify the [URI and Token](https://milvus.io/api-reference/pymilvus/v2.4.x/MilvusClient/Client/MilvusClient.md) instead to connect to the Milvus server:

```python
client = MilvusClient(uri="http://localhost:19530", token="root:Milvus")
```

With the client, you can create collection:
```python
client.create_collection(
    collection_name="demo_collection",
    dimension=768,  # The vectors we will use in this demo has 768 dimensions
)
```

 ingest data:
```python
res = client.insert(collection_name="demo_collection", data=data)
```

and perform vector search:

```python
query_vectors = embedding_fn.encode_queries(["Who is Alan Turing?", "What is AI?"])
res = client.search(
    collection_name="demo_collection",  # target collection
    data=query_vectors,  # a list of query vectors, supports batch search req
    limit=2,  # number of returned results (topK)
    output_fields=["vector", "text", "subject"],  # specifies fields to return
)

```

## Why Milvus

Milvus is designed to handle vectors, which are numerical representations of unstructured data, together with other scalar data types such as integers, strings, and JSON objects. Users can store scalar data with vectors to conduct vector search with metadata filtering.

* **High Performance and Horizontal Scalability**
  * Milvusâ€™s microservice and distributed architecture decouples compute and storage, allowing it to manage diverse traffic patterns and independently scale components like query nodes and data nodes. This flexible setup enables resource allocation tailored to read-heavy or write-heavy workloads, optimizing performance. For a detailed performance evaluation, see [VectorDBBench](https://zilliz.com/vector-database-benchmark-tool).

* **Intuitive API and SDKs**
  * Milvus implements easy-to-use RESTful and gRPC API for vector search, data query and data management. Milvus also provides SDKs for [Python](https://github.com/milvus-io/pymilvus), [Java](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus-sdk-java), [Go](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus-sdk-go), [C++](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus-sdk-cpp), [Node.js](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus-sdk-node), [Rust](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus-sdk-rust), and [C#](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus-sdk-csharp) languages.

* **High Availability**
  * Milvus is highly available and fault tolerant through [built-in replication](https://milvus.io/docs/replica.md), [coordinator failover](https://milvus.io/docs/coordinator_ha.md#Coordinator-HA), and a multi-layer architecture with [storage-compute disaggregation](https://milvus.io/docs/data_processing.md#Data-insertion) and reliable [data persistence](https://milvus.io/docs/four_layers.md#Storage) using etcd, log broker, and object storage.

* **Various Vector Index Types and Hardware Acceleration**
  * Milvus supports all major vector index types, including IVF, HNSW, FLAT (brute-force), DiskANN, GPU Index and quantization-based variations, optimized for different scenarios. Milvus also implements instruction-level acceleration to speed up vector search performance, and supports GPU index such as NVIDIA [CAGRA](https://github.com/rapidsai/raft).

* **Efficient Metadata Filtering**
  * Milvus has various optimizations to make vector search efficient when combined with metadata filtering, especially at high filtering rate, where post-filtering doesn't work, [VectorDBBench](https://zilliz.com/vector-database-benchmark-tool) shows the performance.

* **Sparse Vector for Full Text Search and Hybrid Search**
  * In addition to semantic search via dense vector embeddings, Milvus also supports full text search with sparse vector. User can also combine dense vector and sparse vector through multi-vector feature and perform hybrid search. Milvus supports up to 10 vector fields in a single collection. Milvus supports hybrid search on dense and sparse vector columns, or multiple dense vector columns. The data from multi-path retrieval can be merge and rerank with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) and Weighted Scoring. For details, refer to [Hybrid Search](https://milvus.io/docs/multi-vector-search.md).

Milvus is trusted by AI developers in startups and enterprises to develop applications such as text and image search, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and recommendation systems. Milvus powers mission-critical business for many users, including [Salesforce, PayPal, Shopee, Airbnb, eBay, NVIDIA, IBM, AT&T, LINE, and ROBLOX](https://milvus.io/use-cases).

## Integration


Milvus integrates with popular AI development stacks such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, and OpenAI, providing a robust vector database foundation that supports a variety of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), semantic search, multi-modal and agent-based applications. Milvus works for both open-source embedding models and embedding service, in text, image and video modalities. Milvus has connectors with third-party tools and data sources like Fivetran, Airbyte, Apify, Apache Spark and Apache Kafka that allows developers to create advanced data pipelines. Milvus can also work with tools for orchestrating, evaluating, and optimizing RAG workflows.
